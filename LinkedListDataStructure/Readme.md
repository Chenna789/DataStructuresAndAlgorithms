# Linked List

A LinkedList is a linear data structure which stores element in the non-contiguous location. The elements in a linked list are linked with each other using pointers Or in other words, LinkedList consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Types

There are 3 types of linked lists.

   1) Singly Linked List - Each node has refence to next node and last node will have next pointer as null. Example: 1->2->3->4->null, head pointer is 1 and tail is 4
   2) Doubly Linked List - Each node has refence to next node and previous node as well and last node will have next pointer as null. Example: 1<->2<->3<->4->null, head pointer is 1 and tail is 4.
   3) Circular Linked List - Each node has refence to next node and previous node as well and last node will have next pointer as starting node circularly. Example:
