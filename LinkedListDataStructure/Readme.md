# Linked List

A LinkedList is a linear data structure which stores element in the non-contiguous location. The elements in a linked list are linked with each other using pointers Or in other words, LinkedList consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

## Types

There are 3 types of linked lists.

### Singly Linked List:
Each node has refence to next node and last node will have next pointer as null. 
   #### Example: 
<img src="LinkedListDataStructure/src/resources/SingleLinkedList.png" height="100" />

### Doubly Linked List:
Each node has refence to next node and previous node as well and last node will have next pointer as null.
   #### Example:
<img src="LinkedListDataStructure/src/resources/DoubleLinkedList.jpg" height="150" />

### Circular Linked List:
Each node has refence to next node and previous node as well and last node will have next pointer as starting node circularly. 
   #### Example:
